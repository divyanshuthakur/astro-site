Working on difficult and meaningful issues interest me, and I can be found stepping out of the design role into product management, research, writing, or whatever is necessary to bring clarity to a problem.

I started my career consulting with organizations to design their web platforms. Eventually I landed at Insider where I built apps for live shows and event ticketing. I also worked with Paytm on their merchant platform.

As of today, I'm at ReferralCandy designing their Saas product that helps e-commerce companies grow their referral marketing sales.

In my spare time I make comics, tinker around with code, read and ride bikes. I am constantly learning something new, it's what keeps me mentally active. Right now I've started learning the piano along with some music theory.

I did my post-grad from IDC IIT Bombay, studying transportation design. Prior to that I was part of a racing team which designed, fabricated and raced Formula spec race cars.
